## About this

This project was inspired by this tutorial: [Code a Dictionary with React and Material UI - Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToXna81iij0), which has functionalities that needed to be updated because of changes in the API that it uses and the last update of MUI, and also styling differences.

And consumed the API: [Free Dictionary API](https://dictionaryapi.dev/)
